1. Cart contains multiple Media items, Store contains multiple Media items, and CompactDisc contains multiple Tracks.
2. If the object being evaluated is not an instance of Media, the equals() method will return false.
3. Since Book, CompactDisc, and DigitalVideoDisc inherit from Media, the objects book, cd, and dvd are also considered instances of Media.
4. The class Media implements the Comparable interface.
5. The compareTo() method is required to return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer depending on whether the current object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object, respectively.
6. No, it is not possible to implement the Comparable interface more than once in the Media class because it is used for internal comparisons.
7. I have overridden the compareTo() method specifically in the DigitalVideoDisc class.
