Question 1:

Accessor methods, commonly known as getter and setter methods, are used to access and modify the internal state
of an object in object-oriented programming languages like Java. Getter and setter methods in Java encapsulate 
private fields, allowing controlled access to retrieve and modify data. Getters provide read-only access to field values, 
while setters enable the assignment of new values to the fields.

Objects should hide their implementation details to allow for changes in the implementation without affecting
the code that uses the object. Accessors can create problems when a field's type needs to be changed, 
as it requires modifying all the code that uses the accessor methods. Making instance variables public or 
using accessors violates encapsulation and can hinder maintenance and evolution of the programs.

Question 2:


If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructor methods in a class, each with a different set of parameters. 
This is known as constructor overloading. You can create a constructor method to build a DVD by title and another 
constructor method to build a DVD by category.
