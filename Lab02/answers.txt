Accessor methods, commonly known as getter and setter methods, are used to access and modify the internal state of an object in object-oriented programming languages like Java. Getter and setter methods in Java encapsulate private fields, allowing controlled access to retrieve and modify data. Getters provide read-only access to field values, while setters enable the assignment of new values to the fields.

Objects should hide their implementation details to allow for changes in the implementation without affecting the code that uses the object. Accessors can create problems when a field's type needs to be changed, as it requires modifying all the code that uses the accessor methods. Making instance variables public or using accessors violates encapsulation and can hinder maintenance and evolution of the programs.
